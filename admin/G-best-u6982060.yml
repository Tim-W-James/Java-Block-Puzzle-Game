  is entirely my own work, with the following documented exceptions:

# Use this to list names of people who you collaborated with, and a
# comment about what you collaborated on.
#
# Add as many "name+comment" entries as necessary
# (or remove it altogether if you haven't collaborated with anyone)

# Use this to list any code that you used that you did not write,
# aside from code provided by the lecturer.  Provide a comment
# explaining your use and the URL to that code and the licence for
# that code
#
# Add as many "url+licence+comment" entries as necessary
# (or remove it altogether if you haven't used any external code)

# I wish to submit the following classes as entirely my own (remove this if
