comments:
  - Really well commented, makes it very to understand how the function processes the gameboard to derive solutions
  - Really good use of acc to look at each square and really great way of integrating acc into calculating the x,y coordinates
  - While there are quite a lot of if statements, you have used them effectively and necessarily, especially the if-continue statements
  - Lines 233-236 could use 'returnUnusedTiles' function in Tile class instead
  - implementation of code to get the run time to under 1 minute is AMAZING!!!
  - Perhaps simplifying your code into two separate methods could make it easier on the eyes but your fantastic runtime says otherwise ^^
